# packet-sniffer

## Requirements

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```
## Descirption

I developed a packet sniffer for a Universtiy assignment.

The specific sniffer will capture the first 10 packtes from the network traffic ( of course the code can be modified ).
I provided only the `source.c` code for security reasons. 

## Compile

`Linux`: Recommended compiler ~ `gcc` ( In the process you should add `-lpcap` to your command ).
